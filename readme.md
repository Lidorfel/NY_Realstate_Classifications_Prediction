## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the pacages.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
pip install graphviz
pip install seaborn
```

## Usage

```bash
numpy: Fundamental package for scientific computing with support for multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions.

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library with DataFrame and Series data structures for easy handling of structured data.

sklearn.tree: Implements decision tree-based models for classification, including DecisionTreeClassifier, and provides tree visualization with plot_tree.

sklearn.model_selection: Tools for model selection and evaluation, including data splitting with train_test_split and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

sklearn.metrics: Evaluation metrics for assessing model performance, such as accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, and classification_report.

matplotlib.pyplot: Plotting library for creating various types of visualizations, used for data and model visualization.

scipy.stats: Module within SciPy for statistical functions and distributions, including entropy calculation with entropy.

sklearn.preprocessing: Functions for data preprocessing, such as feature scaling with MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler, and categorical variable encoding with LabelEncoder.

random: Python standard library module for generating random numbers and making random selections.

graphviz: External graph visualization tool used for visualizing decision trees created with scikit-learn.

sklearn.ensemble: Ensemble learning methods, including RandomForestClassifier, which combines multiple decision trees.

sklearn.neighbors: Implementation of k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms, such as KNeighborsClassifier for classification tasks.

sklearn.naive_bayes: Implementation of naive Bayes classifiers, including GaussianNB based on the Gaussian distribution assumption.

sklearn.cluster: Algorithms for clustering, such as KMeans for partitioning data into clusters based on similarity.

## The Connection between the files
```bash
we first examined and described the dataset and the relevant data to our project in the
ProjectEDA.ipynb file which helped us understand what are we facing (this was the EDA part of the project)

After that we started to apply changes on the data set in the FinalProject.ipynb which we did some
preprocessing, predictions, callsifications etc.

We also used the file DecisionTree.ipynb to help us understand how the decision trees work.
